# Mockups

## Users
- Staff. A member of FreeGeek Chicago's Staff Collective that is allowed to view personal information
- Admin. An individual that is trusted to manage time-sheet info and lookup volunteer records, but does not have access to any personal information (incident reports, address, emergency contact)
- User. Any registered volunteer.
- Special Account. Accounts created that provide the system with an altenative data entry method. An example is new user sign up. By default, we have a way for an admin to add a new volunteer, but we might also want volunteers to self signup during orientation. Both methods add a user, but they have different interfaces.
